I think this is the best place because she's getting to an age where she can roll over and fall out of the bed so it will be safer for her to go to sleep in the cot at the beginning of the night and I can bring her into my bed for bedtime feeds.

We have just bought one so will be setting that up today/tomorrow. When she was younger and needed lots of night time feeds, bed with me was best (I follow all the safety guidance on co-sleeping). Now that she doesn't need to feed as often, having her in bed with me encourages her to wake more often for feeds. I feel she needs to still be close to me but somehow being in the bedside cot will hopefully mean she wakes a few less times for milk in the night? we shall see!
